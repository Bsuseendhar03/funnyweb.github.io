            Created by Moniker, an Amsterdam-based experimental interactive design studio founded by Luna Maurer, Jonathan Puckey, and Roel Wouters, Pointer Pointer has quickly become an Internet sensation with nary any promotion on the part of its creators. â€œWe never actually launched the website.

        <i>
            Zoomquilt is a collaborative art project that takes art in an interesting, semi-kinetic direction. By 'stitching' together various artworks in a style that allows for each piece to be 'zoomed' in continuously, the effect is a seamless transition from one work to the next with a sort of 'falling down a hole' effect.
